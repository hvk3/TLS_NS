Steps for compiling the programs:

i) Go to the appropriate directory, and run 'make'.
ii) Run './server' to start the CA, which is responsible for exchanging ports.
iii) Run './client <IP>' where IP is the IP address of the server initiated in step (ii). If the same system has the server as well as the client,
use 127.0.0.1 as the IP.

The program supports multiuser communication, and can be extended for mutual authentication by adding a few lines of code.

Assumptions : 
i) The server has to be kept in check, so as to sign the requests as and when they arrive.
Handled by adding the -batch flag to the system call.
ii) Not more than 10000 connections are simultaneously active.

Basic error handling has been done; however the server and clients seem to crash if socket ports aren't available.

Do not remove the CA's certificate or key files (cacert.pem and cakey.pem in ca_server/). If removed, regenerate them by calling : 
'openssl req -x509 -config openssl-ca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -out cacert.pem -outform PEM' in ca_server.
